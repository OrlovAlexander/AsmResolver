  - [x] Full access to sections, data directories and their interpretations.
  - [x] Import Address Table (IAT) reconstruction and trampolining.
  - [x] Full control over the layout of the final PE file output.
- [x] Rich support for various Win32 resource types.
- [x] Rich support for .NET metadata with an intuitive API similar to `System.Reflection`.
  - [x] Managed, native and dynamic method body support.
  - [x] Easy metadata importing and cloning.
  - [x] Managed resource file serializers and deserializers.
  - [x] Support for AppHost / SingleFileHost bundles.

## Compiling

The solution can be built using the .NET SDK or an IDE that works with it (e.g., Visual Studio and JetBrains Rider). The main packages target LTS versions of various .NET runtimes (.NET 3.5, .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Standard 2.1, .NET Core 3.1, .NET 6.0, .NET 8.0).

To build the project from the command line, use:
```bash
$ dotnet build
```

To run all tests, use:
```bash
$ dotnet test
```
For running the tests successfully, you will need to have additional versions of .NET installed (including STS versions or versions declared EOL), as the unit tests verify reading binaries targeting various .NET runtimes.
To run the tests successfully on MacOS and Linux, `mono` and `wine` are expected to be installed as well.
